# Days Until – Countdown Web App

## Project Overview
Days Until is a JavaScript-based countdown web application that displays the number of days remaining until upcoming events such as holidays or user-defined dates. The application updates countdown values dynamically based on the current date and provides a clear, visual way to track important events.

This project was designed and developed entirely from scratch by me, without the use of AI-assisted coding tools, to strengthen my core front-end and JavaScript skills.
